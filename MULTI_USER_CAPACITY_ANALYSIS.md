## 📈 **CONCURRENT USER CAPACITY ESTIMATES**

### **🎯 Realistic Concurrent User Capacity: 150-300 Users**

#### **Scenario 1: Normal Conference Usage (Recommended)**
```
👥 Concurrent Users: 150-200 users
📊 Resource Usage: 60-70% CPU, 4-5GB RAM
🕒 Response Time: <2 seconds
✅ User Experience: Excellent
```

**Breakdown per concurrent user:**
- **Memory**: ~25-30MB per active session
- **CPU**: ~1-2% per user for typical operations
- **Database**: Optimized queries with indexing

#### **Scenario 2: Peak Registration/Payment Period**
```
👥 Concurrent Users: 100-150 users
📊 Resource Usage: 70-80% CPU, 5-6GB RAM
🕒 Response Time: 2-4 seconds
✅ User Experience: Good
```

**Why lower during peak?**
- Payment processing (Razorpay API calls)
- Email sending (registration confirmations)
- Database write operations increase
- 3D model loading on homepage

#### **Scenario 3: Maximum Burst Capacity**
```
👥 Concurrent Users: 250-300 users
📊 Resource Usage: 85-95% CPU, 5.5-6GB RAM
🕒 Response Time: 3-6 seconds
✅ User Experience: Acceptable (short bursts only)
```

**Only sustainable for 10-15 minutes**
- Risk of memory pressure
- Slower response times
- Potential for some timeouts

## 📈 **SCALING RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Short-term Optimizations (Current VPS):**
```bash
# 1. Enable Redis caching for database queries
# 2. Implement database connection pooling
# 3. Add CDN for static assets
# 4. Enable Nginx caching for API responses
# 5. Monitor and optimize slow database queries
```

### **Medium-term Scaling (200-500 users):**
```
🖥️ Upgrade VPS: 6-8 vCores, 12-16GB RAM
🗄️ Dedicated Database: Separate MongoDB server
🌐 CDN Integration: CloudFlare for global distribution
📊 Monitoring: Add performance monitoring tools
```

### **Long-term Scaling (500+ users):**
```
☁️ Cloud Migration: AWS/GCP/Azure with auto-scaling
🔄 Load Balancing: Multiple app instances
📈 Database Sharding: For large user datasets
🚀 Microservices: Split heavy operations
```
