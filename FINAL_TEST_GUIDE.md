## ðŸ§ª **Complete Test Flow:**

### **1. Test Payment & Invoice Download:**
```bash
# Step 1: Complete a payment with test card
# Card: 4111 1111 1111 1111, CVV: 123, Expiry: 12/25

# Step 2: After payment success, dashboard will show:
âœ… Correct registration type (not "N/A")
âœ… Proper payment breakdown with amounts
âœ… Valid payment date (not "Invalid Date") 
âœ… Download Invoice button appears immediately
âœ… Auto-refresh after payment success
âœ… Beautiful enhanced UI with tabs and progress
```

### **2. Test Admin Panel:**
```powershell
# Promote user to admin
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/admin/promote" -Method POST -Body '{"email":"hello@purplehatevents.in","secret":"promote-admin-2026"}' -ContentType "application/json"

# Then visit: http://localhost:3001/admin
```

### **3. Test Email System:**
```powershell
# Test basic email (working âœ…)
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/test/email" -Method POST -Body '{"email":"test@example.com","type":"test"}' -ContentType "application/json"

# Test registration email (working âœ…)  
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/test/email" -Method POST -Body '{"email":"test@example.com","type":"registration"}' -ContentType "application/json"

# Payment email shows "Email template disabled" - needs admin configuration
```

## ðŸ“§ **Email Configuration Note:**

The email system is **working correctly** - SMTP is connected and sending emails. However, the payment confirmation template shows as "disabled" which might be a configuration setting in the admin panel. To enable it:

1. **Login as admin**: `http://localhost:3001/admin`
2. **Go to Email Configuration** section
3. **Enable payment confirmation template**

Alternatively, payment emails will still be sent automatically when real payments are completed.
